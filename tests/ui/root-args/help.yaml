In this case you would pass `--feature-enables-dep\n          feature:dep`. The option can be passed multiple times, or multiple key-value pairs can be\n          passed at once by separating them with a comma like: `--feature-enables-dep\n          feature:dep,feature2:dep2`.

A \"missing\n          feature\" here means that if `A` has a dependency `B` which has a feature `F`, and the\n          propagation is checked then normally it would error if `A` is not forwarding `F` to `B`.\n          Now this option modifies the behaviour if `A` does not have the feature in the first place.\n          The default behaviour is to require `A` to also have `F`.\n          \n          [default: fix]\n\n          Possible values:\n          - ignore: Ignore this behaviour\n          - report: Only report but do not fix\n          - fix:    Fix if `--fix` is passed\n\n      --fix-hint <FIX_HINT>\n          Dont print any hints on how to fix the error.\n          \n          This is mostly used internally when dispatching, workflows since they come with their\n          hints.\n          \n          [default: on]\n\n          Possible values:\n          - on:  Prints some hint that is (hopefully) helpful\n          - off: Prints no hint at all\n\n      --ignore-missing-propagate <CRATE/FEATURE:DEP/DEP_FEATURE>\n          Ignore single missing links in the feature propagation chain.\n\n      --left-side-outside-workspace <MUTE_SETTING>\n          How to handle the case that the LHS is outside the workspace.\n          \n          [default: fix]\n\n          Possible values:\n          - ignore: Ignore this behaviour\n          - report: Only report but do not fix\n          - fix:    Fix if `--fix` is passed\n\n      --show-version\n          Show crate versions in the output\n\n      --show-path\n          Show crate manifest paths in the output\n\n      --fix\n          Try to automatically fix the problems\n\n      --modify-paths <MODIFY_PATHS>\n          \n\n      --fix-dependency <FIX_DEPENDENCY>\n          Fix only issues with this package as dependency\n\n      --fix-package <FIX_PACKAGE>\n          Fix only issues with this package as feature source\n\n  -h, --help\n          Print help (see a summary with '-h')\n"
